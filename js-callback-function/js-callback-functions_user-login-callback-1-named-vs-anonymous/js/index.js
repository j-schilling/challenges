// In this challenge, you will encounter the following tasks:

// - passing a named callback function into a higher order function
// - writing an anonymous arrow function inside the higher order function call

// ## Tasks

// You should write a callback function in two different ways.
// In both cases your callback function should log the following text to the console:
// "Welcome! You are logged in now."

// 1. Write a function with the "function" keyword named "showWelcomeMessage" which logs the desired text. Then
//    call the higher order function "handleUserLogin" and pass your callback function "showWelcomeMessage" as the first argument.
// 2. Call "handleUserLogin" again but this time write an anonymous function **inside** the function call (i.e. between the round brackets). You can write an anonymous function either:

//    - as an arrow function: ` () => {...}`
//    - as a regular function: ` function() {...}`

// 3. Implement the logic from the previous from "showWelcomeMessage" inside this anonymous function.

// Please switch to the `./js/index.js` file to start the challenge.

function showWelcomeMessage() {
  console.log("Welcome! You are logged in now.");
}

function handleUserLogin(onSuccess) {
  // You might wonder why this function is called `onSuccess`. This will become clear by the fourth challenge! 🤞
  onSuccess();
}

handleUserLogin(showWelcomeMessage);

handleUserLogin(() => {
  console.log("Welcome! You are logged in now.");
});

handleUserLogin(function () {
  console.log("Welcome! You are logged in now.");
});

// Call handleUserLogin below!
